    "In addition, you will also need to improve how the game interacts with the player: the number of rounds to play, which must be an odd number, will be requested to the user until a valid number is entered. Define a new function to make that request.\n",

    "**Hint**: Try to reuse the code that you already coded in the previous challenge. If your code is efficient, this bonus will only consist of simple modifications to the original game."
